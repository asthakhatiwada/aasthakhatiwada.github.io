      Carolina (<strong>MUSC</strong>), working under the supervision of Dr.
      Bethany Wolf (add hyperlink) and Dr. Dongjun Chung (add hyperlink).</p> 
    <p class="mt-4">My current research is focused on developing approaches to integrate
      genomic data with functional annotation data applied to complex autoimmune
      diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,
      ulcerative colitis, Crohnâ€™s disease). More generally, my research is
      focused on identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs that
      influence complex diseases while also identifying potential mechanisms
      linking disease-associated SNPs to the disease.</p> 
    <p class="mt-4">Aside from independent research, I also enjoy multidisciplinary
      collaborations, and have worked with clinicians, epidemiologists, and
      basic and translational science researchers on multiple projects. I
      usually work alongside my collaborators to define research questions,
      design studies, perform statistical analysis, discuss results and coauthor
      manuscripts.</p> 
    <p class="mt-4">Before joining MUSC, I received a MS degree in Mathematics (statistics
      concentration) from ETSU (add hyperlink), and a BS degree in Math
      (actuarial science emphasis) and BA in Economics from MSUM (add
      hyperlink).</p></div>`;
